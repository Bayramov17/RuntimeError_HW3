              I study IT because I believe we can develop our world with the help of technology. Speaking of interests, I prefer to live in the moment, there's wonder inside of me, that wants to try and get an idea of everything. That's why I like to deal with different things from time to time.

              From my childhood, I'm in love with designing and programming is the digital way of designing. Therefore, I'm an IT student now. Programming seems like a kind of "Narnia" of codes where I will bring in my imaginations to reality.

              Studying IT was my childhood dream. I chose this area to realize this dream, and I saw that this area is expanding day by day and my interest in this field increased.
              When it comes to interests, I have some interests such as coding, listening to music especially retro music, and sometimes gaming.

              <p>
                “Everyone Can Program!”. Under this slogan every year, <a href="https://hourofcode.com/az/en" target="_blank" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> Hour Of Code </a> creates a one-hour project to inspire kids to code. Our #RuntimeError group in 15.12.2020 made a one hour of meeting with 6th and 7th-grade students of Republican Humanities Gymnasium named after S.J.Pishevari, and observed methods of easy coding. It was a surprise for us to see such talented and creative kids who desire to learn programming. We hope that we gave them the first step to an amazing world of IT!

              <h2>Creating a Website</h2>
              <p>
                Teamed up with the knowledge and a bit of minimalism in a design, we created an outstanding web-page, that has a big number of features and technologies implemented, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Another important note to make is that the web-page is responsive, meaning it can be visited via mobile or tablet and the user will not lose the quality of the web-flow we tried to create. Advanced features are added, such as the "hamburger" navigation bar for mobile users and Dark Mode that keeps the web-experience the same even at night time. With the help of flexbox and CSS3, we were able to create smooth transitions and animations to improve the user experience.

              <p>
                “Robotics” project was all about exploring how to build and write software for <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/mindstorms-ev3" target="_blank" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Lego Mindstorms</a> robots. This project required us to use the special software EV3 Classroom. Having this software and the documentation from the Lego website, we were able to create software that allows for a robot to move along the line and avoid obstacles. The development environment of EV3 shares the same ideas as in Hour Of Code, which had a positive impact since we were already familiar with the structure. We won’t include specific details here, because the software is still in the stage of development, but we hope that we can achieve our goal as soon as possible.
